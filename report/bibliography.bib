Al proceso proinflamatorio generado por malos hábitos alimentarios, la sobrealimentación calórica de alto índice glicémico, y estilos de vida sedentarios, se atribuye un papel relevante en la patogénesis del síndrome metabólico, así como en sus posibles complicaciones en pacientes de covid-19 con comorbilidades asociadas. Es posible reducir la condición inflamatoria del síndrome metabólico mediante modificaciones en el estilo de vida y hábitos alimentarios, que prevengan la obesidad y sus efectos en la resistencia a la insulina, lo cual propicia reducir la gravedad asociada a los procesos inflamatorios inherentes. Palabras clave: síndrome metabólico; obesidad; resistencia a la insulina; fructosa; inflamación; covid-19. ABSTRACT Metabolic syndrome includes a set of cardiovascular risk factors associated with resistance to insulin, favoring the appearance of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus type 2. Its etiology is attributed to the combination of genetic and environmental factors, associated to lifestyle, and favoring a proinflammatory and prothrombotic status that worsens the clinical characteristics of the patients with COVID-19. The objective of the review was to analyze the current state of the scientific knowledge in research on the interrelationship between glucide metabolism disorders and metabolic syndrome, associated with the exacerbated proinflammatory condition in COVID-19 patients. Searches were conducted in PubMed, SciELO, CinicalKey, and LILACS databases. A relevant role in the metabolic syndrome pathogenesis is attributed to the inflammatory process generated by poor eating habits, high caloric overfeeding, and to sedentary lifestyle, and also to possible complications with associated comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. It is possible to reduce the metabolic syndrome inflammatory condition through life style and alimentary habits changes that prevent obesity and its effects on insulin resistance and propitiate the reduction of the disease severity associated with the inherent inflammatory processes.},

   abstract = {Background: Decline in mitochondrial function occurs with aging and may increase mortality. We discuss mitochondrial contribution to Covid-19 sepsis, specifically the complex interaction of innate immune function, viral replication, hyper-inflammatory state, and HIF-α/Sirtuin pathways. Methods: Articles from PubMed/Medline searches were reviewed using the combination of terms “SARS-CoV-2, Covid-19, sepsis, mitochondria, aging, and immunometabolism”. Results: Evidence indicates that mitochondria in senescent cells may be dysfunctional and unable to keep up with hypermetabolic demands associated with Covid-19 sepsis. Mitochondrial proteins may serve as damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) activating innate immunity. Disruption in normal oxidative phosphorylation pathways contributes to elevated ROS which activates sepsis cascade through HIF-α/Sirtuin pathway. Viral–mitochondrial interaction may be necessary for replication and increased viral load. Hypoxia and hyper-inflammatory state contribute to increased mortality associated with Covid-19 sepsis. Conclusions: Aging is associated with worse outcomes in sepsis. Modulating Sirtuin activity is emerging as therapeutic agent in sepsis. HIF-α, levels of mitochondrial DNA, and other mitochondrial DAMP molecules may also serve as useful biomarker and need to be investigated. These mechanisms should be explored specifically for Covid-19-related sepsis. Understanding newly discovered regulatory mechanisms may lead to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets.},

   abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis has been identified as a main factor leading to pulmonary dysfunction and poor quality of life in post-recovery Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) survivor’s consequent to SARS-Cov-2 infection. Thus there is an urgent medical need for identification of readily available biomarkers that in patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection are able to; (1) identify patients in most need of medical care prior to admittance to an intensive care unit (ICU), and; (2) identify patients post-infection at risk of developing persistent fibrosis of lungs with subsequent impaired quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality. An intense amount of research have focused on wound healing and Extracellular Matrix (ECM) remodelling of the lungs related to lung function decline in pulmonary fibrosis (PF). A range of non-invasive serological biomarkers, reflecting tissue remodelling, and fibrosis have been shown to predict risk of acute exacerbations, lung function decline and mortality in PF and other interstitial lung diseases (Sand et al. in Respir Res 19:82, 2018). We suggest that lessons learned from such PF studies of the pathological processes leading to lung function decline could be used to better identify patients infected with SARS-Co-V2 at most risk of acute deterioration or persistent fibrotic damage of the lung and could consequently be used to guide treatment decisions.},

   abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a deadly pandemic with surging mortality rates and no cure. COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with a range of clinical symptoms, including cough, fever, chills, headache, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, and a loss of smell or taste. Aged individuals with compromised immunity are highly susceptible to COVID-19 and the likelihood of mortality increases with age and the presence of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 highjacks mitochondria of immune cells, replicates within mitochondrial structures, and impairs mitochondrial dynamics leading to cell death. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell and are largely involved in maintaining cell immunity, homeostasis, and cell survival/death. Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria from COVID-19 infected cells are highly vulnerable, and vulnerability increases with age. The purpose of our article is to summarize the role of various age-related comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, and neurological diseases in increasing mortality rates amongst the elderly with COVID-19. Our article also highlights the interaction between coronavirus and mitochondrial dynamics in immune cells. We also highlight the current treatments, lifestyles, and safety measures that can help protect against COVID-19. Further research is urgently needed to understand the molecular mechanisms between the mitochondrial virus and disease progression in COVID-19 patients.},
